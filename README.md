Implements a Widget for Spotify in the Notification Center of OS X 10.10 Yosemite

It uses the AppleScript API for Spotify to get the necesseray information and control it.

Watch Screenshot.tiff for preview.

Download the project, copy the "SpotifyMain.app" to your Applications folder and start it. Maybe in "Today View" settings the widget still needs to manually added.

If you have already installed one version restart the Mac, replace the old SpofityMain.app with the new one and start it.

Update:
- removed refresh button
- widget listens now to playstate of spotify, no manual refresh needed anymore
- if Spofity is closed or stopped (not paused) the widget will disappear and leaves the space for other widgets to take
