Implements a Widget for Spotify in the Notification Center of OS X 10.10 Yosemite

It uses the AppleScript API for Spotify to get the necesseray information and control it.

Watch Screenshot.png for preview.

Download the project, copy the "SpotifyMain.app" to your Applications folder and start it. Maybe in "Today View" settings the widget still needs to manually added. Use "refresh"-Button to get the lastest information about playing song from Spotify. If Spotify is closed the refresh button will start it.
